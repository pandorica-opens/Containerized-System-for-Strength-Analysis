# Development of a Containerized System to Build Geometric Models and Perform Their Strength Analysis

The repository provides the code accompaning the paper ["Development of a Containerized System to Build Geometric Models and Perform Their Strength Analysis"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3274856.3274887) and "[Creating a tool for stress computation with respect surface defects"](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2507/371-375-paper-68.pdf) 

In the folders the pipelines are generally provided by CadFemDemo.ipynb with the preprocessing of the data described in Figure 3 of the [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3274856.3274887)

In the folder 2D the tests are conducted for 2D models with the [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/download/) (now DOLFIN) for solving the Poisson equation and the Gaussian heat model.
